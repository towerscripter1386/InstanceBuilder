# Introduction
Hierarchy builder is a declarative, lightweight DSL meant to be semi-friendly for serialization. It utitlizes tables for it's building purposes and a single recursive function.

Despite being considered lightweight, it is extremely feature rich. Which makes it have a learning curve. This step by step documentation will help you to understand how to use this tool to it's full potential.

In this category you will learn about certain aspects of hierarchy builder like the function args, build loop and etc.

## Note
Hierarchy builder code is quite small compared to other DSL's. The documentation was meant to be for people who don't understand the source code. It is strongly advised to instead read the source code instead of the documentation as it might miss certain features or aspects of hierarchy builder.
